#### Implementation of the algorithm

As long as there are unprocessed tokens in the input string, read the next token:

If the token is:
- A number – put it into the output queue

- A function or a left parenthesis – push it onto the stack

- A function arguments separator (e.g. comma):
    - Move operators from the stack to the output queue until the token at the top of the stack is a left parenthesis. If there is no left parenthesis in the stack, there is an error in the expression.

- Operator (O1):
    - While there is an token-operator O2 at the top of the stack, that has greater precedence than O1 or they have the same precedence and O1 is left-associative:
    - Pop O2 from the stack into the output queue
    - Push O1 onto the stack

- A right parenthesis:
    - While the token at the top of the stack is not a left parenthesis, pop the token-operators from the stack into the output queue.
    - Pop the left parenthesis from the stack and discard it.
    - If there is a function token at the top of the stack, then pop the function from the stack into the output queue
    - If the stack ended before the left parenthesis was read, there is an error in the expression.

If there are no more tokens left in the input string:
- As long as there are operators in the stack:
    - If there is a parenthesis at the top of the stack - there is an error in the expression.
    - Pop the operator from the stack onto the output queue

End.
